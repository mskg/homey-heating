Welcome to the documentation for [`homey-api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homey-api) â€” a JavaScript client for all of Athom's Web APIs, including Homey.

> It is recommended to read the [Homey Web API](https://api.developer.homey.app) guide first before you use this reference.

This documentation is primarily intended by `homey-api` users in a JavaScript environment (Node.js, Browser, React Native). However, all HTTP endpoints are documented as well, if you prefer to use another client.

## Getting Started

Most likely you'll want to access a Homey from a server or front-end. Follow the installation instructions below, then head over to [AthomCloudAPI](http://athombv.github.io/node-homey-api/AthomCloudAPI.html) to get started.

### Node.js

Include Homey API in your project:

```bash
npm install homey-api
```

Then include the API:

```js
const AthomCloudAPI = require('homey-api/lib/AthomCloudAPI');
```

### Browser

Include Homey API from our CDN:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.athom.com/homey-api/$VERSION.js"></script>
```

You can then access the APIs using `window.AthomCloudAPI` etc.

### In-app

To use Homey API inside of an Homey Pro app with the `homey:manager:api` permission, see {@link HomeyAPI#createAppAPI}.
