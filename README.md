## Notes
* Build
  * `npm run homey:run` to run the dev build of the App on your homey.
    * This exposes the API public but does not change thermostat values.
    * Schedules are not read from configuration and are not persisted. You always start with clean values.
  * `npm run start:web` to run the settings app localy. Don't forget to set your Homey url below.
  * `npm run homey:install` to drop a production build onto your Homey.

* Change environment variable HOMEY_DEV_URL to point to your Homey's url, e.g. http://192.168.0.1
* Change environment variable HOMEY_LANG to view the web in either `en` or `nl`

* If you enable remote logging inside the app, you can watch the live trace of the application via [console.re/yourcategory](console.re)

* There is a script `scripts\translate.js` to translate new values from `en` to `nl`. The tool does not touch existing translations in the `app.json`, or `nl.json`.

* Install a *released build onto your Homey* `npm run release:install <tag>`. If you omit the tag, all available version will be printed.
