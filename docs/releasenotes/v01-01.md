## Major Changes and Improvements

### **Change**: Optimized device identification (#34)
Now, all devices are available that support the `target_temperature` capability.

### **Fix**: Target temperatures are not changing (#22, #23, #38)
Workarounds for issues while using `CapabilityInstance`. Code is now using `setCapabilityValue`, with exponential retries. This seems to work quite stable.

### **Change**: Architectural rewrite
Large parts of the UI have been reworked to workaround issues on iOS Safari: Input focus, wrong resizing for fixed divs, blocking of scrolling behind popups, ...
